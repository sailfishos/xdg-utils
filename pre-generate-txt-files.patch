+Description
+
+The xdg-desktop-icon program can be used to install an application launcher or
+other file on the desktop of the current user.
+
+An application launcher is represented by a *.desktop file. Desktop files are
+defined by the freedesktop.org Desktop Entry Specification. The most important
+aspects of *.desktop files are summarized below.
+
+Commands
+
+install
+    Installs FILE to the desktop of the current user. FILE can be a *.desktop
+    file or any other type of file.
+uninstall
+    Removes FILE from the desktop of the current user.
+
+Options
+
+--novendor
+
+    Normally, xdg-desktop-icon checks to ensure that a *.desktop file to be
+    installed has a vendor prefix. This option can be used to disable that
+    check.
+
+    A vendor prefix consists of alpha characters ([a-zA-Z]) and is terminated
+    with a dash ("-"). Companies and organizations are encouraged to use a word
+    or phrase, preferably the organizations name, for which they hold a
+    trademark as their vendor prefix. The purpose of the vendor prefix is to
+    prevent name conflicts.

+
+Desktop Files
+
+An application launcher can be added to the desktop by installing a *.desktop
+file. A *.desktop file consists of a [Desktop Entry] header followed by several
+Key=Value lines.
+
+A *.desktop file can provide a name and description for an application in
+several different languages. This is done by adding a language code as used by
+LC_MESSAGES in square brackets behind the Key. This way one can specify
+different values for the same Key depending on the currently selected language.
+
+The following keys are often used:
+
+Type=Application
+    This is a mandatory field that indicates that the *.desktop file describes
+    an application launcher.
+Name=Application Name
+    The name of the application. For example Mozilla
+GenericName=Generic Name
+    A generic description of the application. For example Web Browser
+Comment=Comment
+    Optional field to specify a tooltip for the application. For example Visit
+    websites on the Internet
+Icon=Icon File
+    The icon to use for the application. This can either be an absolute path to
+    an image file or an icon-name. If an icon-name is provided an image lookup
+    by name is done in the user's current icon theme. The xdg-icon-resource
+    command can be used to install image files into icon themes. The advantage
+    of using an icon-name instead of an absolute path is that with an icon-name
+    the application icon can be provided in several different sizes as well as
+    in several differently themed styles.
+Exec=Command Line
+    The command line to start the application. If the application can open
+    files the %f placeholder should be specified. When a file is dropped on the
+    application launcher the %f is replaced with the file path of the dropped
+    file. If multiple files can be specified on the command line the %F
+    placeholder should be used instead of %f. If the application is able to
+    open URLs in addition to local files then %u or %U can be used instead of
+    %f or %F.
+
+For a complete overview of the *.desktop file format please visit http://
+www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/desktop-entry-spec
+
+Environment Variables
+
+xdg-desktop-icon honours the following environment variables:
+
+XDG_UTILS_DEBUG_LEVEL
+    Setting this environment variable to a non-zero numerical value makes
+    xdg-desktop-icon do more verbose reporting on stderr. Setting a higher
+    value increases the verbosity.
+
+Exit Codes
+
+An exit code of 0 indicates success while a non-zero exit code indicates
+failure. The following failure codes can be returned:
+
+1
+    Error in command line syntax.
+2
+    One of the files passed on the command line did not exist.
+3
+    A required tool could not be found.
+4
+    The action failed.
+5
+    No permission to read one of the files passed on the command line.

+
+Examples
+
+The company ShinyThings Inc. has developed an application named "WebMirror" and
+would like to add a launcher for for on the desktop. The company will use
+"shinythings" as its vendor id. In order to add the application to the desktop
+there needs to be a .desktop file for the application:
+
+shinythings-webmirror.desktop:
+
+  [Desktop Entry]
+  Encoding=UTF-8
+  Type=Application
+
+  Exec=webmirror
+  Icon=shinythings-webmirror
+
+  Name=WebMirror
+  Name[nl]=WebSpiegel
+
+Now the xdg-desktop-icon tool can be used to add the webmirror.desktop file to
+the desktop:
+
+xdg-desktop-icon install ./shinythings-webmirror.desktop
+
+To add a README file to the desktop as well, the following command can be used:
+
+xdg-desktop-icon install ./shinythings-README

+
+Description
+
+The xdg-desktop-menu program can be used to install new menu entries to the
+desktop's application menu.
+
+The application menu works according to the XDG Desktop Menu Specification at
+http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/menu-spec
+
+Commands
+
+install
+
+    Install one or more applications in a submenu of the desktop menu system.
+
+    desktop-file: A desktop file represents a single menu entry in the menu.
+    Desktop files are defined by the freedesktop.org Desktop Entry
+    Specification. The most important aspects of *.desktop files are summarized
+    below.
+
+    Menu entries can be added to the menu system in two different ways. They
+    can either be added to a predefined submenu in the menu system based on one
+    or more category keywords, or they can be added to a new submenu.
+
+    To add a menu entry to a predefined submenu the desktop file that
+    represents the menu entry must have a Categories= entry that lists one or
+    more keywords. The menu item will be included in an appropriate submenu
+    based on the included keywords.
+
+    To add menu items to a new submenu the desktop-files must be preceded by a
+    directory-file that describes the submenu. If multiple desktop-files are
+    specified, all entries will be added to the same menu. If entries are
+    installed to a menu that has been created with a previous call to 
+    xdg-desktop-menu the entries will be installed in addition to any already
+    existing entries.
+
+    directory-file: The *.directory file indicated by directory-file represents
+    a submenu. The directory file provides the name and icon for a submenu. The
+    name of the directory file is used to identify the submenu.
+
+    If multiple directory files are provided each file will represent a submenu
+    within the menu that precedes it, creating a nested menu hierarchy
+    (sub-sub-menus). The menu entries themselves will be added to the last
+    submenu.
+
+    Directory files follow the syntax defined by the freedesktop.org Desktop
+    Entry Specification.
+
+uninstall
+
+    Remove applications or submenus from the desktop menu system previously
+    installed with xdg-desktop-menu install.
+
+    A submenu and the associated directory file is only removed when the
+    submenu no longer contains any menu entries.
+
+forceupdate
+
+    Force an update of the menu system.
+
+    This command is only useful if the last call to xdg-desktop-menu included
+    the --noupdate option.
+
+Options
+
+--noupdate
+    Postpone updating the menu system. If multiple updates to the menu system
+    are made in sequence this flag can be used to indicate that additional
+    changes will follow and that it is not necessary to update the menu system
+    right away.
+--novendor
+
+    Normally, xdg-desktop-menu checks to ensure that any *.directory and
+    *.desktop files to be installed has a vendor prefix. This option can be
+    used to disable that check.
+
+    A vendor prefix consists of alpha characters ([a-zA-Z]) and is terminated
+    with a dash ("-"). Companies and organizations are encouraged to use a word
+    or phrase, preferably the organizations name, for which they hold a
+    trademark as their vendor prefix. The purpose of the vendor prefix is to
+    prevent name conflicts.
+
+--mode mode
+
+    mode can be user or system. In user mode the file is (un)installed for the
+    current user only. In system mode the file is (un)installed for all users
+    on the system. Usually only root is allowed to install in system mode.
+
+    The default is to use system mode when called by root and to use user mode
+    when called by a non-root user.

+
+Desktop Files
+
+An application item in the application menu is represented by a *.desktop file.
+A *.desktop file consists of a [Desktop Entry] header followed by several Key=
+Value lines.
+
+A *.desktop file can provide a name and description for an application in
+several different languages. This is done by adding a language code as used by
+LC_MESSAGES in square brackets behind the Key. This way one can specify
+different values for the same Key depending on the currently selected language.
+
+The following keys are often used:
+
+Type=Application
+    This is a mandatory field that indicates that the *.desktop file describes
+    an application launcher.
+Name=Application Name
+    The name of the application. For example Mozilla
+GenericName=Generic Name
+    A generic description of the application. For example Web Browser
+Comment=Comment
+    Optional field to specify a tooltip for the application. For example Visit
+    websites on the Internet
+Icon=Icon File
+    The icon to use for the application. This can either be an absolute path to
+    an image file or an icon-name. If an icon-name is provided an image lookup
+    by name is done in the user's current icon theme. The xdg-icon-resource
+    command can be used to install image files into icon themes. The advantage
+    of using an icon-name instead of an absolute path is that with an icon-name
+    the application icon can be provided in several different sizes as well as
+    in several differently themed styles.
+Exec=Command Line
+    The command line to start the application. If the application can open
+    files the %f placeholder should be specified. When a file is dropped on the
+    application launcher the %f is replaced with the file path of the dropped
+    file. If multiple files can be specified on the command line the %F
+    placeholder should be used instead of %f. If the application is able to
+    open URLs in addition to local files then %u or %U can be used instead of
+    %f or %F.
+Categories=Categories
+
+    A list of categories separated by semi-colons. A category is a keyword that
+    describes and classifies the application. By default applications are
+    organized in the application menu based on category. When menu entries are
+    explicitly assigned to a new submenu it is not necessary to list any
+    categories.
+
+    When using categories it is recommended to include one of the following
+    categories: AudioVideo, Development, Education, Game, Graphics, Network,
+    Office, Settings, System, Utility.
+
+    See Appendix A of the XDG Desktop Menu Specification for information about
+    additional categories: http://standards.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/
+    menu-spec-1.0.html#category-registry
+
+MimeType=Mimetypes
+    A list of mimetypes separated by semi-colons. This field is used to
+    indicate which file types the application is able to open.
+
+For a complete overview of the *.desktop file format please visit http://
+www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/desktop-entry-spec
+
+Directory Files
+
+The appearance of submenu in the application menu is provided by a *.directory
+file. In particular it provides the title of the submenu and a possible icon. A
+*.directory file consists of a [Desktop Entry] header followed by several Key=
+Value lines.
+
+A *.directory file can provide a title (name) for the submenu in several
+different languages. This is done by adding a language code as used by
+LC_MESSAGES in square brackets behind the Key. This way one can specify
+different values for the same Key depending on the currently selected language.
+
+The following keys are relevant for submenus:
+
+Type=Directory
+    This is a mandatory field that indicates that the *.directory file
+    describes a submenu.
+Name=Menu Name
+    The title of submenu. For example Mozilla
+Comment=Comment
+    Optional field to specify a tooltip for the submenu.
+Icon=Icon File
+    The icon to use for the submenu. This can either be an absolute path to an
+    image file or an icon-name. If an icon-name is provided an image lookup by
+    name is done in the user's current icon theme. The xdg-icon-resource
+    command can be used to install image files into icon themes. The advantage
+    of using an icon-name instead of an absolute path is that with an icon-name
+    the submenu icon can be provided in several different sizes as well as in
+    several differently themed styles.
+
+Environment Variables
+
+xdg-desktop-menu honours the following environment variables:
+
+XDG_UTILS_DEBUG_LEVEL
+    Setting this environment variable to a non-zero numerical value makes
+    xdg-desktop-menu do more verbose reporting on stderr. Setting a higher
+    value increases the verbosity.
+XDG_UTILS_INSTALL_MODE
+    This environment variable can be used by the user or administrator to
+    override the installation mode. Valid values are user and system.
+
+Exit Codes
+
+An exit code of 0 indicates success while a non-zero exit code indicates
+failure. The following failure codes can be returned:
+
+1
+    Error in command line syntax.
+2
+    One of the files passed on the command line did not exist.
+3
+    A required tool could not be found.
+4
+    The action failed.
+5
+    No permission to read one of the files passed on the command line.

+
+Examples
+
+The company ShinyThings Inc. has developed an application named "WebMirror" and
+would like to add it to the application menu. The company will use
+"shinythings" as its vendor id. In order to add the application to the menu
+there needs to be a .desktop file with a suitable Categories entry:
+
+shinythings-webmirror.desktop:
+
+  [Desktop Entry]
+  Encoding=UTF-8
+  Type=Application
+
+  Exec=webmirror
+  Icon=webmirror
+
+  Name=WebMirror
+  Name[nl]=WebSpiegel
+
+  Categories=Network;WebDevelopment;
+
+Now the xdg-desktop-menu tool can be used to add the
+shinythings-webmirror.desktop file to the desktop application menu:
+
+xdg-desktop-menu install ./shinythings-webmirror.desktop
+
+Note that for the purpose of this example the menu items are available in two
+languages, English and Dutch. The language code for Dutch is nl.
+
+In the next example the company ShinyThings Inc. will add its own submenu to
+the desktop application menu consisting of a "WebMirror" menu item and a
+"WebMirror Admin Tool" menu item.
+
+First the company needs to create two .desktop files that describe the two menu
+items. Since the items are to be added to a new submenu it is not necessary to
+include a Categories= line:
+
+shinythings-webmirror.desktop:
+
+  [Desktop Entry]
+  Encoding=UTF-8
+  Type=Application
+
+  Exec=webmirror
+  Icon=shinythings-webmirror
+
+  Name=WebMirror
+  Name[nl]=WebSpiegel
+
+
+shinythings-webmirror-admin.desktop:
+
+  [Desktop Entry]
+  Encoding=UTF-8
+  Type=Application
+
+  Exec=webmirror-admintool
+  Icon=shinythings-webmirror-admintool
+
+  Name=WebMirror Admin Tool
+  Name[nl]=WebSpiegel Administratie Tool
+
+In addition a .directory file needs to be created to provide a title and icon
+for the sub-menu itself:
+
+shinythings-webmirror.directory:
+
+  [Desktop Entry]
+  Encoding=UTF-8
+
+  Icon=shinythings-webmirror-menu
+
+  Name=WebMirror
+  Name[nl]=WebSpiegel
+
+These file can now be installed with:
+
+xdg-desktop-menu install ./shinythings-webmirror.directory \
+      ./shinythings-webmirror.desktop ./shinythings-webmirror-admin.desktop
+
+The menu entries could also be installed one by one:
+
+xdg-desktop-menu install --noupdate ./shinythings-webmirror.directory \
+      ./shinythings-webmirror.desktop
+xdg-desktop-menu install --noupdate ./shinythings-webmirror.directory \
+      ./shinythings-webmirror-admin.desktop
+xdg-desktop-menu forceupdate
+
+Although the result is the same it is slightly more efficient to install all
+files at the same time.
+
+The *.desktop and *.directory files reference icons with the names webmirror,
+webmirror-admin and webmirror-menu which should also be installed. In this
+example the icons are installed in two different sizes, once with a size of
+22x22 pixels and once with a size of 64x64 pixels:
+
+xdg-icon-resource install --size 22 ./wmicon-22.png shinythings-webmirror
+xdg-icon-resource install --size 22 ./wmicon-menu-22.png shinythings-webmirror-menu
+xdg-icon-resource install --size 22 ./wmicon-admin-22.png shinythings-webmirror-admin
+xdg-icon-resource install --size 64 ./wmicon-64.png shinythings-webmirror
+xdg-icon-resource install --size 64 ./wmicon-menu-64.png shinythings-webmirror-menu
+xdg-icon-resource install --size 64 ./wmicon-admin-64.png shinythings-webmirror-admin

+
+Description
+
+xdg-email opens the user's preferred e-mail composer in order to send a mail to
+address(es) or mailto-uri. RFC2368 defines mailto: URIs. xdg-email limits
+support to, cc, subject and body fields in mailto-uri, all other fields are
+silently ignored. address(es) must follow the syntax of RFC822. Multiple
+addresses may be provided as separate arguments.
+
+All information provided on the command line is used to prefill corresponding
+fields in the user's e-mail composer. The user will have the opportunity to
+change any of this information before actually sending the e-mail.
+
+xdg-email is for use inside a desktop session only. It is not recommended to
+use xdg-email as root.
+
+Options
+
+--utf8
+    Indicates that all command line options that follow are in utf8. Without
+    this option, command line options are expected to be encoded according to
+    locale. If the locale already specifies utf8 this option has no effect.
+    This option does not affect mailto URIs that are passed on the command
+    line.
+--cc address
+    Specify a recipient to be copied on the e-mail.
+--bcc address
+    Specify a recipient to be blindly copied on the e-mail.
+--subject text
+    Specify a subject for the e-mail.
+--body text
+    Specify a body for the e-mail. Since the user will be able to make changes
+    before actually sending the e-mail, this can be used to provide the user
+    with a template for the e-mail. text may contain linebreaks.
+--attach file
+
+    Specify an attachment for the e-mail. file must point to an existing file.
+
+    Some e-mail applications require the file to remain present after xdg-email
+    returns.

+xdg-icon-resource — command line tool for (un)installing icon resources
+
+Synopsis
+
+xdg-icon-resource install [--noupdate] [--novendor] [--theme theme] [--context
+context] [--mode mode] --size size icon-file [icon-name]
+
+xdg-icon-resource uninstall [--noupdate] [--theme theme] [--context context]

+
+xdg-icon-resource forceupdate [--theme theme] [--mode mode]
+
+xdg-icon-resource { --help | --manual | --version }
+
+Description
+
+The xdg-icon-resource program can be used to install icon resources into the
+desktop icon system in order to illustrate menu entries, to depict desktop
+icons or to graphically represent file types.
+
+The desktop icon system identifies icons by name. Depending on the required
+size, the choice of icon theme and the context in which the icon is used, the
+desktop icon system locates an appropriate icon resource to depict an icon.
+Icon resources can be XPM files or PNG files.
+
+The desktop icon system works according to the XDG Icon Theme Specification at
+http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/icon-theme-spec
+
+Commands
+
+install
+    Installs the icon file indicated by icon-file to the desktop icon system
+    under the name icon-name. Icon names do not have an extension. If icon-name
+    is not provided the name is derived from icon-file. The icon file must have
+    .png or .xpm as extension. If a corresponding .icon file exists in the same
+    location as icon-file it will be installed as well.
+uninstall
+    Removes the icon indicated by icon-name from the desktop icon system. Note
+    that icon names do not have an extension.
+forceupdate
+    Force an update of the desktop icon system. This is only useful if the last
+    call to xdg-icon-resource included the --noupdate option.
+
+Options
+
+--noupdate
+    Postpone updating the desktop icon system. If multiple icons are added in
+    sequence this flag can be used to indicate that additional changes will
+    follow and that it is not necessary to update the desktop icon system right
+    away.
+--novendor
+
+    Normally, xdg-icon-resource checks to ensure that an icon file to be
+    installed in the apps context has a proper vendor prefix. This option can
+    be used to disable that check.
+
+    A vendor prefix consists of alpha characters ([a-zA-Z]) and is terminated
+    with a dash ("-"). Companies and organizations are encouraged to use a word
+    or phrase, preferably the organizations name, for which they hold a
+    trademark as their vendor prefix. The purpose of the vendor prefix is to
+    prevent name conflicts.
+
+--theme theme
+    Installs or removes the icon file as part of theme. If no theme is
+    specified the icons will be installed as part of the default hicolor theme.
+    Applications may install icons under multiple themes but should at least
+    install icons for the default hicolor theme.
+--context context
+    Specifies the context for the icon. Icons to be used in the application
+    menu and as desktop icon should use apps as context which is the default
+    context. Icons to be used as file icons should use mimetypes as context.
+    Other common contexts are actions, devices, emblems, filesystems and stock.
+--size size
+    Specifies the size of the icon. All icons must be square. Common sizes for
+    icons in the apps context are: 16, 22, 32, 48, 64 and 128. Common sizes for
+    icons in the mimetypes context are: 16, 22, 32, 48, 64 and 128
+--mode mode
+
+    mode can be user or system. In user mode the file is (un)installed for the
+    current user only. In system mode the file is (un)installed for all users
+    on the system. Usually only root is allowed to install in system mode.
+
+    The default is to use system mode when called by root and to use user mode
+    when called by a non-root user.
+
+--help
+    Show command synopsis.
+--manual
+    Show this manual page.
+--version

+
+Environment Variables
+
+xdg-icon-resource honours the following environment variables:
+
+XDG_UTILS_DEBUG_LEVEL
+    Setting this environment variable to a non-zero numerical value makes
+    xdg-icon-resource do more verbose reporting on stderr. Setting a higher
+    value increases the verbosity.
+XDG_UTILS_INSTALL_MODE
+    This environment variable can be used by the user or administrator to
+    override the installation mode. Valid values are user and system.
+
+Exit Codes
+
+An exit code of 0 indicates success while a non-zero exit code indicates
+failure. The following failure codes can be returned:
+
+1
+    Error in command line syntax.
+2
+    One of the files passed on the command line did not exist.
+3
+    A required tool could not be found.
+4
+    The action failed.
+5
+    No permission to read one of the files passed on the command line.

+Examples
+
+To install an icon resource to depict a launcher for the application myfoobar,
+the company ShinyThings Inc. can use:
+
+xdg-icon-resource install --size 64 shinythings-myfoobar.png
+
+To install an icon for a new application/x-foobar file type one can use:
+
+xdg-icon-resource install --context mimetypes --size 48 ./mime-foobar-48.png application-x-foobar
+xdg-icon-resource install --context mimetypes --size 64 ./mime-foobar-64.png application-x-foobar
+
+This will install two icons with the name application-x-foobar but with
+different sizes.

+xdg-mime — command line tool for querying information about file type handling

+
+xdg-mime default application mimetype(s)
+
+xdg-mime install [--mode mode] [--novendor] mimetypes-file
+
+xdg-mime uninstall [--mode mode] mimetypes-file
+
+xdg-mime { --help | --manual | --version }
+
+Description
+
+The xdg-mime program can be used to query information about file types and to
+add descriptions for new file types.
+
+Commands
+
+query
+
+    Returns information related to file types.
+
+    The query option is for use inside a desktop session only. It is not
+    recommended to use xdg-mime query as root.
+
+    The following queries are supported:
+
+    query filetype FILE: Returns the file type of FILE in the form of a MIME
+    type.
+
+    query default mimetype: Returns the default application that the desktop
+    environment uses for opening files of type mimetype. The default
+    application is identified by its *.desktop file.
+
+default
+
+    Ask the desktop environment to make application the default application for
+    opening files of type mimetype. An application can be made the default for
+    several file types by specifying multiple mimetypes.
+
+    application is the desktop file id of the application and has the form
+    vendor-name.desktop application must already be installed in the desktop
+    menu before it can be made the default handler. The application's desktop
+    file must list support for all the MIME types that it wishes to be the
+    default handler for.
+
+    Requests to make an application a default handler may be subject to system
+    policy or approval by the end-user. xdg-mime query can be used to verify
+    whether an application is the actual default handler for a specific file
+    type.
+
+    The default option is for use inside a desktop session only. It is not
+    recommended to use xdg-mime default as root.
+
+install
+    Adds the file type descriptions provided in mimetypes-file to the desktop
+    environment. mimetypes-file must be a XML file that follows the
+    freedesktop.org Shared MIME-info Database specification and that has a
+    mime-info element as its document root. For each new file type one or more
+    icons with name type-subtype must be installed with the xdg-icon-resource
+    command in the mimetypes context. For example the filetype application/
+    vnd.oasis.opendocument.text requires an icon named
+    application-vnd.oasis.opendocument.text to be installed (unless the file
+    type recommends another icon name).
+uninstall
+    Removes the file type descriptions provided in mimetypes-file and
+    previously added with xdg-mime install from the desktop environment.
+    mimetypes-file must be a XML file that follows the freedesktop.org Shared
+    MIME-info Database specification and that has a mime-info element as its
+    document root.
+
+Options
+
+--mode mode
+
+    mode can be user or system. In user mode the file is (un)installed for the
+    current user only. In system mode the file is (un)installed for all users
+    on the system. Usually only root is allowed to install in system mode.
+
+    The default is to use system mode when called by root and to use user mode
+    when called by a non-root user.
+
+--novendor
+
+    Normally, xdg-mime checks to ensure that the mimetypes-file to be installed
+    has a proper vendor prefix. This option can be used to disable that check.
+
+    A vendor prefix consists of alpha characters ([a-zA-Z]) and is terminated
+    with a dash ("-"). Companies and organizations are encouraged to use a word
+    or phrase, preferably the organizations name, for which they hold a
+    trademark as their vendor prefix. The purpose of the vendor prefix is to
+    prevent name conflicts.

+Prints the MIME type of the file /tmp/foobar.png, in this case image/png
+
+xdg-mime query default image/png
+
+Prints the .desktop filename of the application which is registered to open PNG
+files.
+
+xdg-mime install shinythings-shiny.xml
+
+Adds a file type description for "shiny"-files. "shinythings-" is used as the
+vendor prefix. The file type description could look as follows.
+
+shinythings-shiny.xml:
+
+<?xml version="1.0"?>
+<mime-info xmlns='http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/shared-mime-info'>
+  <mime-type type="text/x-shiny">
+    <comment>Shiny new file type</comment>
+    <glob pattern="*.shiny"/>
+    <glob pattern="*.shi"/>
+  </mime-type>
+</mime-info>
+
+An icon for this new file type must also be installed, for example with:
+
+xdg-icon-resource install --context mimetypes --size 64 shiny-file-icon.png text-x-shiny

+Properties
+
+When using xdg-settings to get, check or set a destkop setting, properties and
